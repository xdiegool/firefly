/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file contains definitions of the event queue used by firefly.
 *
 * Firefly is an event driven API. Most actions accesible from the public API
 * will spawn one or more events which must be run in order for the action to be
 * performed.
 * The events will be pushed to the event_queue and pop'ed from the event_queue
 * before execution.
 *
 * This event queue is a priority queue with optional dependecies between
 * events. To solve any conflicts of priority in a dependecy tree priority
 * inheritance is applied. Any depended on event of lower priority will get the
 * effective priority of the event depending on it. In practice all dependecies
 * of an event will be run as soon the event is first in the queue if not
 * before.
