Abstract

   This document provides an introduction to the Firefly library as well
   as the underlying technologies. This document notably does not cover
   the Firefly protocol, see PROTOCOL for an explanation of that.

1  Introduction

   Firefly is hybrid between a framework, a library and a protocol that
   is used to communicate serialized data of arbitrary types between two
   nodes. The framework deals with settings up channels between the
   nodes and communicate the status of those channels to the
   application. The application is free to choose whichever underlying
   protocol to use (e.g. TCP, UDP, Ethernet).

   The library is asynchronous and written with speed, flexibility and
   real time applications in mind. It is written in ISO C99 to make sure
   that the portability and speed requirements are met.


2  Terms

   A couple of different terms may need a definition before delving
   deeper into the library:

      Node
         A computer of some sort running an application which utilizes
         the Firefly library.
      Transport medium
         A combination of network protocol and platform which must be
         implemented. Example implementations are provided for some
         general platforms such as Ethernet and UDP on POSIX systems.
         The transport medium is decoupled from the library to allow
         applications the flexibility to choose the best suitable one.
      Connection
         A connection between two nodes. Connections are identified on
         each node by the current transport layer's address (e.g. IP or
         MAC addresses). Thus, two nodes typically has one connection
         between them.
      Channel
         A channel over which data of specific types is transferred.
         Channels live inside connections and the library provides some
         ability to set properties on channels.
      Encoder
         A Labcomm structure which is used to encode the messages. Each
         channel has one encoder.
      Decoder
         Equal to encoder but is used to decode messages. Each channel
         has one decoder.


3  Underlying Technology

   Firefly builds upon the Labcomm marshalling (or serialization)
   library to transfer custom data types. Labcomm is by design one-way
   and Firefly extends it to enable two-way communication over arbitrary
   transport mediums.
